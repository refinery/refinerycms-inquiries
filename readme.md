### Gem Installation using Bundler (The very best way)

Include the latest [gem](http://rubygems.org/gems/refinerycms-inquiries) into your Refinery CMS application's Gemfile:

    gem "refinerycms-inquiries", '~> 0.9.9.3'

Then type the following at command line inside your Refinery CMS application's root directory:

    bundle install

You don't currently have to do any migrations because Refinery CMS never removed the inquiries tables by default.
This may change in a future version.

## About

__Add a simple contact form to Refinery that notifies you and the customer when an inquiry is made.__

In summary you can:

* Collect and manage inquiries
* Specify who is notified when a new inquiry comes in
* Customise an auto responder email that is sent to the person making the inquiry

When inquiries come in, you and the customer are notified. The inquiry will now show up as an "open" inquiry. The idea is to deal with the inquiry and then "close" it so you know it's been sorted.

## How do I get Notified?

Go into your 'Inquiries' tab in the Refinery admin area and click on "Update who gets notified"

## How do I Edit the Automatic Confirmation Email

Go into your 'Inquiries' tab in the Refinery admin area and click on "Edit confirmation email"
