## About

__Add a simple contact form to Refinery that notifies you and the customer when an inquiry is made.__

In summary you can:

* Collect and manage inquiries
* Specify who is notified when a new inquiry comes in
* Customise an auto responder email that is sent to the person making the inquiry

When inquiries come in, you and the customer are generally notified. As we implemented spam filtering through the [filters_spam plugin](https://github.com/resolve/filters_spam#readme) you will not get notified if an inquiry is marked as 'spam'.

## How do I get Notified?

Go into your 'Inquiries' tab in the Refinery admin area and click on "Update who gets notified"

## How do I Edit the Automatic Confirmation Email

Go into your 'Inquiries' tab in the Refinery admin area and click on "Edit confirmation email"

## How do I change the from address from no-reply@com.au to no-reply@[mydomain].com.au

Simply change the Refinery setting 'Tld Length' in the admin section from 1 to 2 and your domain name will be added.

Note: This only affects top level domains that are two deep (ie: not .com or .org, but does affect .com.au etc).
